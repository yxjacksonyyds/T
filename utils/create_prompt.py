    def get_check_prompt(self):
        prompt = f'''Background: You are an expert in the field of molecular generation and can proficiently generate ligand molecules for proteins based on certain information. You can generate the smiles representation of the ligand molecule for a certain protein target based on the following literature information, binding sites, existing drug molecules, and active substances with high binding affinity. Your current stage is molecular validation (multidimensional evaluation), where you need to evaluate the molecules generated in the previous section, validate, rank, and output them.
###Task: At this stage, your task is to carefully read the molecules you generate in the context, perform verification, validation, and ranking work, and ensure that the smiles are valid. It is forbidden to generate invalid molecules!!! Definitely generate molecules with strong binding affinity!!!! Among them, the molecule ranked first must be the one with the strongest binding force, and we must spare no effort to improve its binding ability, while maintaining its legitimacy.
###Verification Protocol:
1. Chemical validity check: Use RDKit to verify the correctness of SMILES syntax/valence state.
2. Docking verification: AutoDock Vina rapid docking with the original crystal structure (Δ G ≤ -9 kcal/mol)
3. Drug Evaluation: QED ≥ 0.6 and SAscore ≤ 4
4. Comprehensive sorting: Weighted scores based on (0.4 × pKiupred)+(0.3 × QED)+(0.3 × SAscore)
###Output template:
xml
<validation-summary>
<smiles>The only legitimate and highly binding molecule for testing</smiles>
<qed>Predict its qed indicators</qed>
<affinity>Predict their Vina score</affinity>
<sa>Predict its synthesizability index sa</sa>
</validation-summary>
###Attention: The entire process must ensure the generation of legal smiles!!!!!!!!!! The conditions for legal smiles:
1. Grammar level: Atomic symbols must be valid (such as C, [Na+]), bond connections must be clear (single bonds can be omitted, double/triple bonds use=#), parentheses are closed in pairs, ring markers match numbers (such as C1CCCC1), aromatic atoms are lowercase (such as benzene c1ccccc1); 2. At the chemical level: the atomic valence state is reasonable (such as carbon not exceeding 4 bonds), the hydrogen atom is implicitly expressed (special explicit hydrogen such as [NH3]), the charge labeling is correct (such as [Fe+2]), and the overall structure is free of contradictions (such as ring energy closure and ion charge balance).
###注意：请尽量避免以下情况的分子生成：①.出现分子数超过8的大环 ②.出现三个环共用一个分子的情况 ③.分子中杂原子太多 ④.分子中杂原子在同一个环中多次出现。
