2. Dataset
   CrossDocked2020 is a large-scale dataset designed for benchmarking molecular docking and binding pose prediction methods in drug discovery. It contains approximately 22.5 million docked protein-ligand complexes, generated by aligning ligand structures from the PDBbind database to similar protein pockets. Each entry pairs a protein structure with a ligand, providing both crystal structures (when available) and computationally docked poses. This dataset is widely used to train and evaluate machine learning models for tasks like binding affinity prediction and structure-based virtual screening, offering diverse protein targets and ligand scaffolds.
